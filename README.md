# Xperimenter

Xperimenter is a workflow management tool.
Xperimenter manages a workflow tree. In a workflow tree, multiple workflows
share tasks common to them, thus eliminating running the same task multiple
times. Xperimenter is also multi-threading: All the workflows in the tree can
be run simultaneously.

The results from running a workflow tree are stored in a directory structure,
where each directory contains a task. Each directory contains a params.csv
file, which stores the parameters specifying the task. The results from running
the task are also contained in this directory.

A workflow tree is known as a project. The project is stored in project.xml
in its own directory.
